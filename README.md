## Setup

Download the code and switch to `recvis20` branch
```
git clone https://github.com/rstrudel/nmprepr
cd nmprepr
git checkout recvis20
```

To create a new conda environment containing dependencies
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nmprepr
```

To update a conda environment with dependencies
```
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

## Train

### Maze

To train a planning policy on maze environments generated by a 3x3 grid
```
python -m nmp.train Maze-Simple-v0 maze_baseline --horizon 75 --seed 0
```

For 5x5 grids use `Maze-Medium-v0` and for 7x7 grid use `Maze-Hard-v0`.

### Monitor

You can monitor experiments with
```
tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/experiment
```

## Run

Run a planning policy and visualize it with
```
python -m nmp.run Maze-Simple-v0 --exp-name log_dir/params.pkl --seed 100 --horizon 75
```
       
Evaluate the success rate of a policy on 100 episodes
```
python -m nmp.run Maze-Simple-v0 --exp-name log_dir/params.pkl --seed 100 --horizon 75 --episodes 100
```

## Observation

The maze are represented by a set of edges (x1, y1, x2, y2) which are passed through PointNet.
The edge set and goals are centered with respect to the agent current position. You can see below on the left an example of an environment and on the right its representation:

## Logging

By default the checkpointing will be in your home directory. You can change it by defining a `CHECKPOINT` environment variable. Add the following to your `.bashrc` file to change the logging directory.
```
export CHECKPOINT=/path/to/checkpoints
```
